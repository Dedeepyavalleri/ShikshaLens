Problem Statement:"ShikshaLens â€“ Dropout Prediction & Early Intervention System for BPL School Children"

Prediction of student dropout risk rate using Machine Learning(GradientBoosting and XGBoost)

In this project we have built a ML Model using algorithms GradientBoosting and XGBoost out of which GradientBoosting(Accuracy: 1.000) had given us more accuracy compared to XGBoost(Accuracy: 0.996).We even have tested accuracy for other algorithms which includes LogisticRegression(Accuracy: 0.962),RandomForest(Accuracy: 0.926),SVM(Accuracy: 0.944),Gaussian NB(Accuracy: 0.264).


Here dropout risk prediction is done considering factors like Attendence,Overall Academic performance,Participation in other activities.Hence the dropout risk students are being predicted and also been taken care of their respective class teachers through dashboard.

TEACHERS DASHBOARD
In the dashboard every teacher have their own credentials(Username & Password) to login.After login into their accounts a teacher can able to see all his/her class student records.Even dropout risk students will be visible to the teacher along with the dropout cause.An Alert system is incorporated so as to contact such students for easy guidence and intervention.Even the intervention will be known to the teacher so that they can proceed further with predicted students.
